<h2 style="text-align:center">Why Use Agile and Scrum for software development?</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
    <li><h3>Better Visibility</h3></li>
    Agile and Scrum development methodology are well- known for actively involving users/clients throughout the life of
    the product’s development process. This leads to better visibility for key stakeholders involved in the project to
    ensure that everyone’s expectations are managed effectively.

    <li><h3>High Transparency</h3></li>
    This is one of the main characteristics of Agile and Scrum approach. It allows various stakeholders to contribute
    and be completely involved throughout the project. This kind of transparency is available at each and every step of
    the project cycle be it planning, reviews or prioritizing features.

    <li><h3>Allows Early Identification And Easy Resolution Of The Issues</h3></li>
    Agile and Scrum methodology makes sure that there are small incremental releases that are made visible to the team
    and product owner through its development. It helps in the identification of any issues at a much early stage so
    that the same can be resolved without any delay.
    <br><br/>
    Additionally, agile development focuses on clear visibility which ensures early decision making, an important aspect
    to define the success of any software development project

    <li><h3>Exceptional Quality</h3></li>
    Unlike the traditional approach with no flexibility and minimum scope for incorporating any changes to the existing
    model, adaptability is the key characteristic in Agile and Scrum. The methodology ensures that all the changes are
    supported and integrated into the current project leading to exceptional quality. Within the stipulated time and
    cost, Agile and Scrum implementation can bring great results to increase the quality of the product significantly.

    <li><h3>Inexpensive with continuous integration and Iterative releases</h3></li>
    One of the key characteristics of this unique methodology is continuous integration, communication, and iterative
    releases.
    <br><br/>
    Agile and Scrum, as a software approach, strive to build not only the right product (by not basing the requirements
    on assumptions) but also allow you to cut down unnecessary costs and offers higher returns with smaller investments.
    <br><br/>
    By implementing this powerful methodology, businesses are sure to save money by involving stakeholders, lowering
    risk, embracing down and reaching the market quickly.
